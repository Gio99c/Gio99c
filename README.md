### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Giuseppe Concialdi, here you can find the project I've worked on!

### ðŸ”­ About me 
I'm currently attending the MSc in Data Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. I'm a graduated student in Computer Engineering who loves Data Science and Mathematics.
I think that the knowledge about mathematics and the attention for the project design are distinctive features for a programmer and I'm aiming to learn even more about these topics.
I'm fascinated by the themes of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology.
